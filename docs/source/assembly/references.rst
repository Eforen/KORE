RISC-V Assembly Manual
----------------------

The official RISC-V Assembly Programmer's Manual provides comprehensive documentation for RISC-V assembly language programming, including instruction formats, addressing modes, and programming conventions.

* **URL**: https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-asm-manual/blob/main/src/asm-manual.adoc
* **Description**: Official RISC-V Assembly Programmer's Manual
* **Maintained by**: RISC-V International Non-ISA Committee
* **Format**: AsciiDoc source

This manual is particularly useful for understanding:

- RISC-V instruction syntax and semantics
- Assembly programming conventions
- Calling conventions and ABI
- Instruction encoding details
- Pseudo-instructions and their expansions

.. note::
   Since KORE is transitioning to use the RISC-V ISA, this manual serves as an essential reference for understanding the target instruction set architecture.
