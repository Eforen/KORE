# Planned
* Replace conditional negitives and replace with bitwise shifting for handelling of sign extensions (if tests show they are faster)
* Program JType Precom Tests
* Program UType Precom Tests
* For speed make RamController imidiately drop out if op is nop
* Write simple compiler for Risc-V ASM Type I
* Write simple compiler for Risc-V ASM Type S
* Write simple compiler for Risc-V ASM Type B
* Write simple compiler for Risc-V ASM Type U
* Write simple compiler for Risc-V ASM Type J

# Working On
* Write tests for all SType Store Instructions
* Write simple compiler for Risc-V ASM called Kuick Compiler

# Finished
* Write simple compiler for Risc-V ASM Type R
* Change B32_ADD to B32_OP
* Fixed stuff I broke
* Impliment Assembly OP SW
* Refactor Write Cycle to Generalize
* Program BType Full Range Tests
* Program RType Full Range Tests
* Program UType Full Range Tests
* Program JType Full Range Tests
* Program IType Full Range Tests
* Expand S Type Full range test to include registers
* Refactored Names of Type Struct Tests to have Precompiled tests use suffix `_Precomp`
